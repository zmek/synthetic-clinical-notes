# synthetic-clinical-notes
Create and analyse synthetic clinical notes

## Goal
Experiment with generating synthetic medical notes using Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Objectives
1. Learn to create a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP). [Learn More](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/why_RAP_is_important/)
2. Develop prompt engineering skills using LLMs.
3. Create a dataset of synthetic medical notes.

## Why Synthetic Medical Notes?
1. Experiment with ClinicalBert on medical notes.
2. Use synthetic notes for safe experimentation.
3. Assess current and future quality of synthetic text.
