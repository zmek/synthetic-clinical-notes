Pt has been homeless for many years, currently\\n   living on the streets in [**Location (un) 223**] - tends to sleep on a bus stop bench\\n   near his methadone clinic in the [**Location (un) 2161**].  He is familiar with the\\n   shelter system and denies interest in staying in a shelter.

However, he clearly seems to be considering suicide,\\n   stating, \"I just can\\'t cope\\n and speaks of feeling hopeless.\\n   Pt states he sees a psychiatrist \"at a storefront\" in [**Location (un) **] about once a\\n   month, but does not remember the person\\'s name or contact info.  [**Name2 (NI) **]\\n   states he has seen psychologists in the past but did not feel he got\\n   any feedback from them and stopped tx.

He states he tends to spend his\\n   days sleeping in abandoned cars, if he can find any, or on a bus stop\\n   bench.  He denies having any family, friends, or acquaintances in his\\n   life.\\n   Pt dozes off periodically during meeting and also shifts focus several\\n   times to recount traumatic memories from abuse as a child, Vietman, and\\n   the loss of his girlfriend.  SW validated the painful feelings around\\n   these memories and his wish to share them while redirecting him to the\\n   present, recommending he try not to recount detailed traumatic memories\\n   at this time given how triggerig they are for him.  Pt states he is\\n   amenable to meeting with SW again after he has had some rest, as he is\\ntoo exhausted\\n right now to engage further.\\n   Assessment:  60 y.o. single, Caucasian, Catholic man facing multiple\\n   psychosocial stressors including homelessness, PTSD, depressive sx,\\n   grief over death of girlfriend in spring, and h/o substance abuse (on\\n   Methadone maintenance), and lack of support system.  At this time, he\\n   presents with depressive sx including passive SI, hopelessness,\\n   excessive daily tearfulness, tendency to isolate, avolition, lack of\\n   appetite, regular sleep disturbance (appears somnolent, though states\\n   he can\\nt sleep due to intrusive thoughts of trauma and feelings of\\n   grief).  At this time, pt is unable to mobilize around a discharge\\n   plan, preoccupied by feelings of hopelessness and\\ngoing crazy.\\n  While\\n   he has been discharged to the street in the past when he has been able\\n   to consent to this plan, a street-discharge does not appear appropriate\\n   at this time, given pt\\ns depressive sx and inability to articulate what\\n   he wants to do.
