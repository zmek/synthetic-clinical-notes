    "* Demonstrate an example of calling the ChatGPT API \n",

    "In order to seed the LLM with some patient information, I start with some patient parameters provided by synthetic data. NHS England prepared a synthetic dataset of A&E presentations. A blog post about it is [here](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2019-01-24-exploring-methods-for-creating-synthetic-a-e-data). The dataset can be accessed from [this website](https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/a-e-synthetic-data/resource/81b068e5-6501-4840-a880-a8e7aa56890e#). \n",

    "A notebook exploring these columns is [here](explore-nhse-ae-data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides, among other things, the hospital length of stay and whether the patient was admitted. As my interest is in clinical notes that are generated during hospital visits, I'm more interested in inpatients. I will use the length of stay information to ask ChatGPT to pick a medical condition that would merit inpatient admission. I also investigate whether, by giving the lengh of stay information, the admission note would indicate a severity that could plausibly (at least barring any unexpected developments in the patient's trajectory) result in a such a stay. \n",

    "* on their readability as admission notes (although as I am not medical, I cannot do a full evaluation)\n",

The pain typically occurs during physical exertion and is relieved by rest. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing episodes of shortness of breath, especially during exertion or lying flat. There is no associated cough or wheezing.\\n\\nPast Medical History:\\nThe patient has a known history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He is a current smoker with a 30 pack-year smoking history. There is no past history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or stroke.\\n\\nPhysical Examination:\\nUpon examination, the patient appears in mild distress due to chest pain. Vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Cardiovascular examination reveals regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally.\\n\\nAssessment:\\nBased on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is coronary artery disease.\\n\\nPlan:\\n1. Admission to the hospital for further evaluation and management.\\n2. Continuous monitoring of vital signs.\\n3. EKG to assess for any evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia.\\n4. Cardiac enzymes to evaluate for myocardial injury.\\n5. Chest X-ray to evaluate for any evidence of heart failure or pulmonary edema.\\n6. Transthoracic echocardiogram to assess cardiac function and anatomy.\\n7. Initiation of antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, and statin therapy.\\n8. Cardiology consultation for further management.\\n9. Lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation, regular exercise, and dietary changes.\\n\\nAdditional considerations:\\nThe patient's prolonged stay in the Emergency Department and the expected length of hospital stay of 12.0 days indicate the severity of his condition and the need for comprehensive evaluation and management.\""
