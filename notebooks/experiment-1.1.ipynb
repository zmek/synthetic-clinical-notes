    "# Experiment 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the previous experiment 1, the goal is: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Demonstrate an example of calling the ChatGPT API \n",
    "* Solve some of the problems in formatting output\n",
    "* Use ChatGPT to (a) pick a medical condition and (b) generate an admission note given some simple patient details\n",
    "* Evaluate the output for (a) successful generation of text (b) plausibility of admission note\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to seed the LLM with some patient information, I start with some patient parameters provided by synthetic data. NHS England prepared a synthetic dataset of A&E presentations. A blog post about it is [here](https://open-innovations.org/blog/2019-01-24-exploring-methods-for-creating-synthetic-a-e-data). The dataset can be accessed from [this website](https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/a-e-synthetic-data/resource/81b068e5-6501-4840-a880-a8e7aa56890e#). \n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook exploring these data is [here](explore-nhse-ae-data.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides, among other things, the hospital length of stay and whether the patient was admitted. As my interest is in clinical notes that are generated during hospital visits, I'm more interested in inpatients. I will use the length of stay information from the A&E dataset to ask ChatGPT to pick a medical condition that would merit inpatient admission. I also investigate whether, by giving the lengh of stay information, the admission note would indicate a severity that could plausibly (at least barring any unexpected developments in the patient's trajectory) result in a such a stay. \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous iterations I have already found limitations when evaluating the output on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* on their readability as admission notes (although as I am not medical, I cannot do a full evaluation)\n",
    "* on the plausbility of the medical condition chosen by ChatGPT leading to a hospital visit of this length\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as I'm currently not able to access ChatGPT v4, I want to save 100 notes using gpt-3.5-turbo-0613, for comparison later. So I will continue with this approach for now.\n"

The agent is given the admission note, and asked to act as a senior colleague to appraise a junior colleague's decision to admit the patient.
