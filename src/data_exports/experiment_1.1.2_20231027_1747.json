History of Present Illness: Patient describes the pain as sharp in nature, not radiating, and worsening with movement. The patient denies any accompanying nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements. Past Medical History: No significant medical history reported. Physical Examination: Vital signs were as follows: BP: 130/85 mmHg, pulse: 90 beats per minute, respirations: 20 per minute, temperature: 98.6 F. On abdominal examination, there was generalized tenderness on palpation. Bowel sounds were present. Assessment: The patient's labs were ordered including CBC, metabolic panel, and liver enzymes. Initial impression is of a nonspecific abdominal pain. Plan: Patient was admitted for further evaluation and management, with the aim of finding the underlying cause.

The patient is advised to report any changes in symptoms or any new symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting. There should be a low threshold for the patient to return to the ER if symptoms intensify or additional concerning symptoms emerge. Outpatient labs will be obtained for further investigation. NSAIDs and paracetamol prescribed for pain control."

No history of fever or cough, though patient was unable to provide extensive history due to decreased alertness. Past Medical History: Unknown at this moment due to patient's altered state. Physical Examination: Confused, appears older than stated age. Vitals stable, afebrile. Lab: Initial test results show abnormal liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and electrolyte imbalances. Assessment: The patient presents with an altered level of consciousness which could be secondary to several factors including infection, medication side effects, metabolic imbalances or an underlying neurological condition. Further diagnostic tests are necessary to narrow down and identify the cause. Plan: Administer fluids, obtain head CT, blood culture, urinalysis and toxicology panel.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Tachycardic, SpO2 of 88% on room air, respiratory rate of 30/min, bilateral crepitations on auscultation. ASSESSMENT: Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical exam findings, presenting condition likely falls in the category of diseases of the respiratory system. PLAN: Admit for further workup including cultures, complete blood count, chest x-ray and to start on antibiotics empirically for likely pneumonia.

No prior incidents reported. Past Medical History: No significant past medical history. Non-smoker and occasional alcohol consumer. Physical Examination: Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the lower quadrants with increased bowel sounds. Vital signs within normal limits. Assessment: Symptoms are consistent with gastroenteritis. Plan: Admit for hydration, symptom management, and further diagnostic workup. Consider initiating antibiotic therapy based on stool culture results. Monitor vital signs closely. Educate patient on the importance of hand hygiene to prevent spread of disease.",
        "Admission_Note_agreement": "disagree",
        "Admission_Note_agreement_reason": "In a hospital at capacity, the decision to admit versus discharge hinges on whether a condition can be safely managed outside of the hospital setting. In this case, the patient's symptoms suggest a mild case of gastroenteritis, which can be adequately managed in the community with oral rehydration therapy and over-the-counter symptom relief. There is no need for immediate in-hospital treatment unless the patient's condition significantly deteriorates or fails to respond to treatment. Always consider the burden on the hospital system when making admission decisions.",
        "Admission_Note_if_discharged": "The symptoms presented by the patient suggest a case of gastroenteritis, which is typically non-severe and can be managed in the community rather than in a hospital setting. The treatment plan would be oral rehydration therapy, rest, maintaining adequate nutrition and symptom management with OTC medications. A stool sample should be sent to the lab for bacteria and other infectious agents. Should symptoms significantly worsen or fail to improve, the patient should be admitted."

He reports previous similar but minor discomforts which self-resolved after a short period. \n\nPast Medical History: The patient has a 10-year history of diverticulitis, well-managed with dietary modification, and no previous surgical interventions. No known drug allergies. \n\nPhysical Examination: His abdomen is distended, with mixed bowel sounds; tenderness is localized in the lower left quadrant. No palpable masses were detected. \n\nAssessment: Given the patient's history, physical exam findings, and the ICD-10 chapter of Diseases of the digestive system, an intestinal obstruction is suspected. This diagnosis aligns with his symptomology and past history and would be significant enough to warrant his 8-day hospital stay. \n\nPlan: Admit the patient, begin intravenous fluid rehydration, and cease oral intake. Order a CT scan of the abdomen to confirm obstruction. Consultation with a gastrointestinal surgeon is needed if conservative management fails or if the patient's condition deteriorates.",

        "Admission_Note_if_discharged": "If the patient were to be discharged instead of admitted, an abdominal X-ray series would be performed, and if required, an urgent outpatient CT scan can be organized. The patient would be advised to follow a clear liquid diet in addition to their usual dietary modifications for diverticulitis and to maintain hydration. Close follow-up would be arranged with their primary care provider and if symptoms worsen, they should return to the emergency department immediately."

The pain is described as continuous, gradually worsening, rated as 8 on a scale of 0-10. Accompanied by symptoms of nausea and vomiting. The patient denies any change in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or other systemic symptoms. Past medical history is unremarkable. On examination, the patient appears in distress due to pain, vitals stable with mild tachycardia, abdominal examination reveals rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa. Preliminary labs show leucocytosis with a shift to the left. Based on the clinical presentation, an urgent surgical consultation is made with a preliminary diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The plan is to manage the patient with IV hydration, antibiotics, analgesics, and pending surgical evaluation for possible appendectomy.",
