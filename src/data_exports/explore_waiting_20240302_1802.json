The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's slow and deliberate movements and slurred speech suggest possible cerebellar dysfunction, which can occur in some cases of migraine.Based on these findings, I recommend the following plan:1. Admit the patient to the hospital for further evaluation and management.2. Order a CT scan of the head to rule out any intracranial causes of the patient's symptoms.3. Provide the patient with a triage of pain medications, including ibuprofen and sumatriptan, to help manage his headache.4. Monitor the patient's vital signs and fluid status closely, and provide appropriate fluids and electrolyte replacement as needed.5. Consider prescribing a preventive medication for the patient, such as a triptan or an ergotamine, to help reduce the frequency and severity of his migraine attacks in the future.6. Arrange for the patient's workplace to provide accommodations for him, such as a quiet room or flexible work schedule, to help manage his symptoms and prevent further exacerbation of his condition."}, "immediate actions": "Immediate actions needed:\n\n1.
