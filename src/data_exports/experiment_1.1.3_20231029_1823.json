        "Admission_Note_if_discharged": "The patient's clinical status, which currently includes severe symptoms of a cerebrovascular event, leaves no chances for management outside the hospital setting. Immediate CT scans needed to rule out hemorrhage and consideration for thrombolysis presents further justification for immediate care. Upon discharge, appropriate follow-up with a neurologist and the primary care provider will be necessary. The patient needs to continue blood pressure medication and consider beginning anticoagulant therapy, in association with the neurologist."

Assessment: Given the patient's presentation, and the worsening stomach pain and bloating, a diagnosis of Gastritis is highly likely. This is further supported by her age group and her symptoms.

She is advised to return immediately to the emergency department if symptoms become severe such as persistent vomiting, blood in vomit, inability to maintain hydration via oral intake, decrease in urination, dizziness, or any other alarming symptoms. She should also seek immediate care if symptoms persist beyond 7 days.
