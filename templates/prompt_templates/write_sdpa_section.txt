You will help me fill out a form documenting factors affecting the discharge of a hospital inpatient. The Section is !<INPUT 0>! 

The attributes of the patient are !<INPUT 1>! 

The answer choices are !<INPUT 2>! 

When you see `choices=[x, y, z]` then you are to choose one item from that list (x, y, or z in that example). Do not choose more than one option. Do not choose something that is not in the list.

I will now provide examples where the Section is `Fruit`, the attributes are `A plump juicy fruit used for cider` and the answer choices are `Shape=[round, long]`

Example 1 shows a good example of a filled out form 

```
Section: Fruit
Shape: round
```

Example 2 shows a bad example of a filled out form 
```
Section: Fruit
Shape: spherical
```
This is a bad example because shape attribute spherical is not from the list of options to choose from

Example 3 shows another bad example of a filled out form 
```
Section: Fruit
Shape: long
```
This is a bad example because, while `long` is a valid option, it is not the best answer for plump juicy fruit used for cider, which would be an apple, which is round
