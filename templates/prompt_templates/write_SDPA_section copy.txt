You will help me fill out a form documenting factors affecting the discharge of a hospital inpatient. The section is !<INPUT 0>! 

If you see `choices=[x, y, z]` then you are to choose one item from that list (x, y, or z in that example). Do not choose more than 1 option. Do not choose something that is not in the list.

The choices are !<INPUT 1>! 

If you see something like:
```
Footwear: choices=[sneakers, sandals]
    if (choice == sneakers) {
        Brand: choices=[Nike, Adidas]
    else {
        Brand: choices=[Crocs, Teva]
    }
```
Then you must fill out the items in the if/else block based on the choice you made in the previous item in the form.

I will now provide examples for the following design sheet for a fruit
```
Name: 
Taste: choices=[sweet, sour]
    if (choice == sweet) {
        Type: choices=[sugary, honeyed]
    else {
        Kick: choices=[acidic, tart]
    }
```

Example 1 shows a good example of a filled out form:
```
Section: Apple
Taste: sweet
Type: sugary
```

Example 2 shows a bad example of a filled out form:
```
Section: Apple
Taste: sweet
Type: Dancer
```
This is a bad example because Type attribute Dancer is not from the list of options to choose from

Example 3 shows another bad example of a filled out form:
```
Section: Banana
Taste: sweet
Kick: acidic
```
This is a bad example because, while `Kick: acidic` is a valid option, it should only be picked when the taste is sour, not sweet.
